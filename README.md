# 7seg

Implementation of a binary to decimal input converter with 7seg display for the 8051 microcontroller. 

I used the (MCU8015 IDE)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcu8051ide/files/mcu8051ide/1.4.9/] for this project and the virtual hardware feature. 

Used virtual Hardware:
- Multiplexed 7seg Display
- 

You can find the configuration files for the virtual hardware in the repo

> Note: Because I was a bit lost I implemented the modulo myself instead of using the already existing instruction (it's a feature not a bug ğŸ˜‰)
